**Python Files In Order:**      
            
**1-  main.py:**        
In the main module, I have imported the modules from chapter1.                 
                       
**2-  globalVars.py:**     
I used the GlobalVariables module to initiate my global variables.      
I have used four global variables for this game. My global variable are:      
     Username, 
     Swordfighting, 
     Horseriding, and
     Grabweapons   
               
**3-  starttheGame.py:**        
 This module displays the game's name, and asks the user if they wish to start game.          
 If user selects start game, the module ends by calling gameintro module           
               
**4-  gameintro.py:**     
This module provides a game introduction and the story of the prince and The module ends and calls Chapter1 module.            
               
**5-  chapter1.py:**     
Module starts chapter 1 introduction and then offers player to select from skillchoice which is Horseriding and Swordfighting options:           
if the player selects either one, the message of skill prompts or the program restarts. If the player selects Horseriding or swordfighting, the skill updates and moves on to chapter 2.

**6-  Chapter2.py:**     
The skills gained from module 1 will help the player to tackle the enemy here, if the player selects and learn horseriding in module 1, then the player escapes them easily on Horseback! or if the player selects and learn swordfighting in module1 then he smashes off the enemies. and then the call ends and chapter3 begins.

**7-  Chapter3.py:**         
Module starts chapter 3 and prompts the player to master the skills 
and ask to learn from the wise man.
if the player selects to master in horseriding or swordfighting, the player gains a point in the selected skill and becomes a master and then moves on to chapter 4.
            
**8-  Chapter4.py:**     
Module starts chapter 4 introduction of the scene then asks the user to prepare for the attack and prepare the army as well.
then asks to select the weapons wisely and then the module ends and it moves on to module 5.

**9-  Chapter5.py:**     
Module starts chapter 5 introduction and here comes the turn!

if the player has skill points of horseriding =1 and swordfighting =1 then he will be able to save the maid, if not he cant. and the game restarts.
The pro tip is to select the skills from the previous chapters wisely so that the player has both Horseriding and swordfighting skills so as to conquere the kingdom back.
